# SAMD21G18
This chip has a 32bit Cortex M0+ CPU and is very versatile, especially in applications that require many forms of serial communication:

It is Arduino compatible and has native USB + six serial communication interfaces that can be configured to be either UART, I2C or SPI depending on needs.
